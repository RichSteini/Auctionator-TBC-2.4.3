# Auctionator for TBC 2.4.3

* Auction prices in item tooltips (with an AH full scan function to update the prices)
* Straightforward UI
* Protection against posting too low
* Recipe reagent costs and profits in crafting views
* Searches with lots of filters with a search history and organised into shopping lists
* Undercut scan and one-click cancelling for owned auctions

## Addon folder structure

Rename the downloaded folder to "Auctionator", remove "TBC-2.4.3-main" from the folder name and put the folder in:
..\Interface\AddOns
..\Interface\AddOns\Auctionator

## Acknowledgements

I only made this version (WOTLK backport) work for the TBC 2.4.3 client by rewriting the multi-sell procedures. If you like the addon want to support the original authors that made it, go to [Auctionator Classic/Retail](https://github.com/Auctionator/Auctionator).
